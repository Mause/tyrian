# What is the purpose of your project?
To create a small language, with custom parser and lexer,
than com/transpiles into Python Bytecode

# What software already exists that either partly solves this problem or can assist you in supporting it?
A few other projects do essentially the same thing, but ideally, i would use
a third party parser and lexer instead of writing my own.
