4. List and describe the minimum features which will need to be implemented for your project to be considered 'successful'. [3 marks]
 * Lex, parse, and compile a simple program successfully
 * Have comprehensive documentation
 * Have a simple program run with correct behaviour in the Python VM
 * Have basic syntax error detection and notification - full syntax checking does not seem to be possible with a recursive decent parser
 * have a niceish command line interface

5. How will you evaluate performance of your product? Describe three (3) non-trivial (i.e. not 'program doesn't crash') key performance indicators. [6 marks]
 * Does not use excessive amounts of memory
 * Runs a simple program within a decent timeframe
 * compile a program within a decent timeframe

6. Create a set of Data Flow Diagrams for your project (at least the Context Diagram and Level 0 DFD - Level 1 if required). [10 marks]

7. Using your list of features from Part 4, estimate the time it will take to reach them. Create a Gantt or PERT chart for your timeline. Make sure you keep an eye on this, as it will be a significant part of your final presentation. [3 marks]

8. Describe at least two areas which could be used to extend your project in future revisions and provide some discussion on what would be required to pursue them. [4 marks]
 * Try and have the output be compatible between py3k revisions
 * Optimization of the compiled output (this and the one above may be mutually exclusive)
 * have it be a full lisp machine, with support for lisp macros (the horror!)
