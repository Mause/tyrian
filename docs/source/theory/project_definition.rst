Project Definition
==================

What is the purpose of your project?
------------------------------------
To create a small language, with custom parser and lexer,
than com/transpiles into Python Bytecode

What software already exists that either partly solves this problem or can assist you in supporting it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A few other projects do essentially the same thing as what i am doing.

Ideally, i would:
 * use a third party parser and lexer instead of writing my own.

What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
----------------------------------------------

The inputs are as follows;
 * a input filename for a valid lisp program
 * an output filename

Output:
 * a .pyc file
