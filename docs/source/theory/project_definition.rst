Project Definition
==================

What is the purpose of your project?
------------------------------------
    To create a small language, with custom parser and lexer,
    that compiles into Python Bytecode

What software already exists that either partly solves this problem or can assist you in supporting it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A few other projects do essentially the same thing as what I am doing.

    Ideally, I would:
     * Use a third party parser and lexer instead of writing my own.

What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
----------------------------------------------

    The inputs are as follows;
     * A input filename for a valid lisp program
     * An output filename
     * Various options

    Output:
     * A .pyc file
