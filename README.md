tyrian
======

Tyrian is a implementation of lisp in python bytecode... hopefully

Basic usage is as follows;
```sh
$ python tyrian.py <options> <input_filename> <output_filename>
```

Documentation is available here (hopefully): http://tyrian.readthedocs.org

Documentation source is also available in docs/, but will require cloning with submodules;

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/Mause/tyrian.git --recurse-submodules
```

and can be generated like so under *nix;


```sh
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

and like so on windows;
```bat
> cd docs
> make.bat html
```
