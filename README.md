tyrian
======

Tyrian is a implementation of lisp in python bytecode... hopefully

Basic usage is as follows;
```sh
$ python cli.py <options> <input_filename> <output_filename>
```

Documentation source is available in docs/, and can be generated like so under *nix;

```sh
$ cd docs
$ make html
```

and like so on windows;
```bat
> cd docs
> make.bat html
```
